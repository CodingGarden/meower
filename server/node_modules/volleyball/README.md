### Small Express HTTP logger for debugging asynchronous requests and responses

```js
const app = require('express')()
const volleyball = require('volleyball')

app.use(volleyball)
```

Volleyball is a minimal Connect-style middleware function which logs incoming requests and outgoing responses as separate events. It optionally supports the [`debug`](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug#readme) module.

## Motivation

Logging HTTP cycles can be approached in several ways, each with its own drawbacks:

*   Log only upon **request**. Drawback: we cannot log the corresponding response, which happens later (if at all).
*   Log only upon **response**, attaching the request. Drawback A: if the server never sends a response, e.g. due to a bug, the request will not be logged either. Drawback B: two temporally distinct events are conflated, misleadingly.
*   Log both upon **request** and **response**. Drawback: it is not necessarily clear which responses are for which requests.

Volleyball takes the last approach, and assigns randomly-generated ids to label request-response pairs. It is designed for student project development, teaching beginning programmers how HTTP servers and asynchronicity work. It may also be useful as a low-configuration debug tool.

## Usage

### `volleyball`

The `volleyball` module can be used directly as demonstrated in the first example. The module defaults to using `process.stdout` for output.

### `volleyball.custom(config)`

A customized logging middleware can be generated by calling `custom` with a configuration object:

```js
const logger = volleyball.custom({ debug: true }) // default namespace 'http'
// const logger = volleyball.custom({ debug: 'custom-namespace' })
// const logger = volleyball.custom({ debug: debugInstance })

app.use(logger)
```

The `debug` property logs using the [`debug`](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug#readme) module. It supports the following values:

| value    | result                                                                                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `true`   | uses a new debug instance with a default namespace of `'http'`                                                           |
| string   | uses a new debug instance with a custom namespace                                                                        |
| function | uses any function, such as a pre-generated debug instance. Note that the function will be called with colorized strings. |
